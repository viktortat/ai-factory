The `agents` array can include any supported agent IDs: `claude`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `roocode`, `kilocode`, `antigravity`, `opencode`, `warp`, `zencoder`, `codex`, `copilot`, `gemini`, `junie`, or `universal`. Each agent keeps its own `skillsDir`, installed skills list, and MCP preferences. Claude Code agents also persist `subagentsDir` and `installedSubagents`, so `ai-factory update` can refresh `.claude/agents/` alongside skills. AI Factory additionally stores internal `managedSkills` and `managedSubagents` hash maps in `.ai-factory.json`; they are omitted from the example above for brevity.

The optional `extensions` array tracks installed extensions by name, original source, and version. `ai-factory update` now refreshes these extensions from their saved sources before base-skill updates, and `ai-factory extension update [name] --force` refreshes them without running the full base-skill update flow.

Extension refresh uses the saved `source` field:

- npm sources are checked against the npm registry and skipped when the published version is unchanged
- GitHub sources fetch `extension.json` through the GitHub API before cloning
- local paths and non-GitHub git sources require `--force` for refresh

When GitHub-backed extension refreshes are frequent, set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to raise the GitHub API rate limit used by these checks.

## `.ai-factory/config.yaml` — User Preferences

User-editable configuration file for language, paths, workflow settings, and rules hierarchy. Created by `/aif` during project setup.

For the complete key-by-key schema plus the built-in skill read/write matrix, see [Config Reference](config-reference.md).

**Two-file architecture:**
- `.ai-factory.json` — CLI state (agents, installed skills, MCP config) — managed by ai-factory package
- `config.yaml` — User preferences (language, paths, workflow) — edited by developers

```yaml

```

**Current config-aware skills** read `config.yaml` at Step 0. This currently includes:
- Core workflow and quality commands: `/aif`, `/aif-plan`, `/aif-implement`, `/aif-verify`, `/aif-commit`, `/aif-review`, `/aif-roadmap`, `/aif-explore`, `/aif-loop`, `/aif-rules`
- Additional utility commands: `/aif-architecture`, `/aif-docs`, `/aif-fix`, `/aif-improve`, `/aif-evolve`, `/aif-reference`, `/aif-security-checklist`

Other skills are config-agnostic for now and rely on repository context, explicit arguments, or fixed non-configurable paths such as `skill-context`.

Current config-agnostic built-ins include `/aif-best-practices`, `/aif-build-automation`, `/aif-ci`, `/aif-dockerize`, `/aif-grounded`, and `/aif-skill-generator`.

**Git workflow semantics:**
- `git.enabled: false` disables branch/worktree assumptions entirely. `/aif-plan full` still creates a rich full plan, but it stores it in `paths.plans/<slug>.md` without running git commands.
- `git.base_branch` is the branch used for diff, review, verify, and merge guidance. Skills must not hardcode `main`.
- `git.create_branches: false` keeps git awareness enabled but disables automatic branch creation. This lets teams keep full plans without forcing branch-per-feature flow.
- `git.skip_push_after_commit: true` makes `/aif-commit` stop after local commit without showing push prompt.
- `paths.plan` remains the default fast-plan file. If you prefer fast plans inside `paths.plans/`, change `paths.plan` manually in `config.yaml`.
- `paths.docs` controls where `/aif-docs` writes the detailed documentation pages. `README.md` remains the landing page in the project root.

**Current schema limits:** `config.yaml` still leaves `.ai-factory/skill-context/` fixed by command contract. `README.md` and `docs-html/` remain fixed by current documentation workflow.

### Rules Hierarchy

AI Factory supports a three-level rules hierarchy:

1. **paths.rules_file** — Axioms (universal project rules)
   - Short, flat list of hard requirements
   - Managed by `/aif-rules`

2. **rules/base.md** — Project-specific base conventions
   - Naming conventions, module boundaries, error handling
   - Created by `/aif` from codebase analysis

3. **rules.<area>** — Area-specific rule file paths in `config.yaml`
   - Examples: `api`, `frontend`, `backend`, `database`
   - Created by `/aif-rules area:<name>`

Each area is a named config key whose value is the rule file path. Example: `rules.api: .ai-factory/rules/api.md`.

**Priority:** More specific rules win. `rules.api` > `rules/base.md` > `paths.rules_file`

## MCP Configuration

AI Factory can configure these MCP servers:

| MCP Server | Use Case | Env Variable |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| GitHub | PRs, issues, repo operations | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| Postgres | Database queries | `DATABASE_URL` |
| Filesystem | Advanced file operations | - |
| Chrome Devtools | Browser inspection, debugging, performance | - |
| Playwright | Browser automation, web testing | - |

Configuration saved to agent's settings file (e.g. `.mcp.json` for Claude Code, `.cursor/mcp.json` for Cursor, `.vscode/mcp.json` for GitHub Copilot, `.roo/mcp.json` for Roo Code, `.kilocode/mcp.json` for Kilo Code, `opencode.json` for OpenCode). GitHub Copilot uses `servers` as the root object in `mcp.json`; other standard agents use `mcpServers` (OpenCode uses `mcp`).

### Environment Variables

MCP configs use `${VAR}` placeholders for credentials (GitHub Copilot receives `${env:VAR}` in `.vscode/mcp.json`). Set them before launching the agent:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token"
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/db"
```

Or replace the placeholders with actual values directly in the config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "env": { "GITHUB_TOKEN": "ghp_your_token" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Project Structure

After initialization (example for Claude Code — other agents use their own directory). Paths shown below are the default locations; many AI Factory artifacts can be relocated via `config.yaml`.

## Reflex Loop Files

`/aif-loop` keeps state lean and resumable between sessions. Defaults are shown below; the base loop directory can be relocated via `paths.evolution`.

- `.ai-factory/evolution/current.json` — active loop pointer (to current run)
- `.ai-factory/evolution/<task-alias>/run.json` — current run snapshot (loop execution state)
- `.ai-factory/evolution/<task-alias>/history.jsonl` — append-only event history
- `.ai-factory/evolution/<task-alias>/artifact.md` — latest artifact output

For full phase contracts and stop conditions, see [Reflex Loop](loop.md).

## Evolution Cursor File

`/aif-evolve` uses a lightweight cursor to process patches incrementally. Defaults are shown below; patch and evolution-log directories can be relocated via `paths.patches` and `paths.evolutions`.

- `.ai-factory/evolutions/patch-cursor.json` — last processed patch marker
- First run (no cursor): evolve reads all patches
- Subsequent runs: evolve reads patches newer than the cursor (plus a small overlap window to catch missed points)
- To force a full rescan: delete `patch-cursor.json` and run `/aif-evolve` again

## Best Practices

### Artifact Ownership and Context Gates
- Keep context artifact ownership command-scoped (roadmap by `/aif-roadmap`, rules by `/aif-rules`, architecture by `/aif-architecture`, research by `/aif-explore`).
- Treat `/aif-commit`, `/aif-review`, and `/aif-verify` as read-only consumers of context artifacts by default.
- Use `WARN` for non-blocking gate findings (missing optional files, ambiguous mapping) and `ERROR` for blocking violations.

### Logging
All implementations include verbose, configurable logging:
- Use log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Control via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
- Implement rotation for file-based logs

### Commits
- Commit checkpoints every 3-5 tasks for large features
- Follow conventional commits format
- Meaningful messages, not just "update code"

### Testing
- Always asked before creating plan
- If "no tests" - no test tasks created
- Never sneaks in test code
