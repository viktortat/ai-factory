# Code Review Assistant

Perform thorough code reviews focusing on correctness, security, performance, and maintainability.

## Behavior

### Without Arguments (Review Staged Changes)

1. Run `git diff --cached` to get staged changes
2. If nothing staged, run `git diff` for unstaged changes
3. Analyze each file's changes

### With PR Number/URL

1. Use `gh pr view <number> --json` to get PR details
2. Use `gh pr diff <number>` to get the diff
3. Review all changes in the PR

## Context Gates (Read-Only)

Before finalizing review findings, run read-only context gates:

- Check `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md` (if present) for boundary/dependency alignment issues.
- Check `.ai-factory/RULES.md` (if present) for explicit convention violations.
- Check `.ai-factory/ROADMAP.md` (if present) for milestone alignment and mention missing linkage for likely `feat`/`fix`/`perf` work.

Gate result severity:
- `WARN` for non-blocking inconsistencies or missing optional files.
- `ERROR` only for explicit blocking criteria requested by the user/review policy.

`/aif-review` is read-only for context artifacts by default. Do not modify context files unless user explicitly asks.

### Project Context

**Read `.ai-factory/skill-context/aif-review/SKILL.md`** — MANDATORY if the file exists.

This file contains project-specific rules accumulated by `/aif-evolve` from patches,
codebase conventions, and tech-stack analysis. These rules are tailored to the current project.

**How to apply skill-context rules:**
- Treat them as **project-level overrides** for this skill's general instructions
- When a skill-context rule conflicts with a general rule written in this SKILL.md,
  **the skill-context rule wins** (more specific context takes priority — same principle as nested CLAUDE.md files)
- When there is no conflict, apply both: general rules from SKILL.md + project rules from skill-context
- Do NOT ignore skill-context rules even if they seem to contradict this skill's defaults —
  they exist because the project's experience proved the default insufficient
- **CRITICAL:** skill-context rules apply to ALL outputs of this skill — including the review
  summary format and the checklist criteria. If a skill-context rule says "review MUST check X"
  or "summary MUST include section Y" — you MUST augment the output accordingly. Producing a
  review that ignores skill-context rules is a bug.

**Enforcement:** After generating any output artifact, verify it against all skill-context rules.
If any rule is violated — fix the output before presenting it to the user.

### Critical Issues
[Must be fixed before merge]

### Suggestions
[Nice to have improvements]

### Questions
[Clarifications needed]

### Positive Notes
[Good patterns observed]
```

## Review Style

- Be constructive, not critical
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Provide code examples when helpful
- Acknowledge good code
- Prioritize feedback by importance
- Ask questions instead of making assumptions

## Examples

**User:** `/aif-review`
Review staged changes in current repository.

**User:** `/aif-review 123`
Review PR #123 using GitHub CLI.

**User:** `/aif-review https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123`
Review PR from URL.

## Integration

If GitHub MCP is configured, can:
- Post review comments directly to PR
- Request changes or approve
- Add labels based on review outcome

> **Tip:** Context is heavy after code review. Consider `/clear` or `/compact` before continuing with other tasks.
